# udacity-pdsnd-python-project

Udacity Python Project: 
For this project, I used Python, Numpy, and pandas to explore data related to bike share systems in Chicago, New York City, and Washington D.C. Wrote Python code to import the data, answer interesting questions by computing descriptive statistics, and create an interactive experience that takes in raw input in the terminal to present these statistics.
